## Interview Question by Meta/Facebook: Users By Average Session Time

Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.

<b> facebook_web_log </b>
- user_id: int
- timestamp: datetime
- action: varchar
